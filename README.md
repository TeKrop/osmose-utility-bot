> Discord Bot made with Discord.js for Osmose Gaming Community. Using specific commands, users can dynamically create voice channels (`chan` and `owchan`), move people from one voice channel to another (`massmove`), send a message when a specific event is occuring (`watcher`), etc. Warning : it was designed to be used on only one guild (server) at a time.

```sh
npm install

## üë®‚Äçüíª Technical details

For code syntax and style, I'm using **Airbnb JS Style Guide** (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). I'm using **Discord.js** library, **emoji-regex** in order to be able to parse emojis, **mustache** for simple templating when displaying messages, and **winston** for logging.
